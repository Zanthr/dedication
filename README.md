Kit Awarding Plugin

Fork of DevotedMC's version of the CivEx Dedication plugin.

Ideally, this plugin will award players with the permission
    to summon certain item kits based on the player's 
	completion of a cooresponding task. For instance, 
	chopping down a certain amount of wood would allow a 
	player to use a kit which gives them one or more stone
	axes.
